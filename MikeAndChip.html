                <h2>Level Design</h2>
                <p><a>I worked a lot on the games level design I planned out all three areas of the game and there layout. I added 
                    the actors to the scene includeing, base platforms, obstacles, and Chip activated platforms/doors. I also added the 
                    collectibles. I added what ever blueprints/Scripts these actors need to work as well.</a></p>

                <h2>PlayerJumping/Gliding</h2>
                <p><a>I worked on elements of the players movement such as creating 
                    there jump/double jump and gliding in scripts/blueprints. 
                     </a></p>

                <h2>Collecting FloppyDisk/Microchips</h2>
                <p><a>I worked on makeing it so the player can gather floppydisk and microchips
                    and it reflects that in the UI. I also created the behaviors of how it get collected
                    and added to scene in scripts/blueprints.

                <h2>Credits</h2>
                <p><a>I made the UI for the credits as well as made it so the credits play at a certain part 
                    of the game and fade out.
                </a></p>

                <h2>Audio Design/Dialogue</h2>
                <p><a>I found all the sounds and music for the game as well as edited them to better fit into the game. 
                    I also made it so there sounds are able to be played in game when certain actions happen.
                    I also wrote the dialogue for the game as well as made it so they play at certain points.
