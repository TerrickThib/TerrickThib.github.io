            <h1>About</h1>
            <p><a> HellHeim Pinball is a game I worked on as a Designer and Programmer it is a Pinball game where 
                the board is made to look like the gates of Hellheim. You use the pattles or in this case the swords
                to keep the ball in HellHeim as long as you can and score points. </a></p>
                <h1>Task</h1>
                <h2>Board Design/Collisons</h2>
                <p><a>I created the board layout by using references from other pinball games as well as 
                    edited the board so the ball doesnt get stuck and rolls well. I also handled all the
                    colliders in the game so the ball doesnt break out of bounds and so it rolls well.
                </a></p>

                <h2>Gameplay/Ball Movement/Respawning</h2>
                <p><a>I worked on gameplay and ball movemment. The overall feel of the game and how the ball moves 
                    around the board.

                <h2>UI Scoring And Respawn</h2>
                <p><a>I made it so the UI in the game updates when the ball scores points aswell as when it
                    falls into the drain and loses a ball.
